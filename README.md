## Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive ETL framework in C++, suitable for large-scale data processing workflows. Its modular architecture promotes easy extension, maintenance, and integration with other data systems.

---

## Features

- Modular **Input** layer for data ingestion (currently supports JSON)
- Flexible **Transformation** pipeline for data processing
- **Output** layer for saving or exporting processed data
- Designed for scalability and performance
- Extensible architecture for adding new data formats and processing steps

---

## Architecture

The framework is organized into distinct layers:

- **Input Layer:** Reads raw data from various sources, starting with JSON files.
- **Processing Layer:** Parses and transforms data according to business rules.
- **Output Layer:** Saves processed data to files, databases, or streams.

Each layer is separated with clear interfaces to facilitate maintenance, testing, and expansion.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher (e.g., g++, MSVC)
- [RapidJSON](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) library for JSON parsing

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Ensure RapidJSON headers are available in the `include/` directory or adjust include paths.

3. Build the project:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude src/main.cpp src/input.cpp src/process.cpp src/output.cpp -o etl_framework
```

### Note:
Modify the build command as needed based on your environment and file organization.

---

## Usage

1. Prepare an input JSON file (`input.json`) in your working directory.
2. Run the application:

```bash
./etl_framework
```

3. Output will be saved according to your implementation (e.g., `output.json`).

*(Expand this section with specific instructions for your transformation pipeline or CLI parameters as your project develops.)*

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue to discuss first.

---

## Future Plans

- Expand input/output formats (CSV, XML, databases)
- Build a plugin system for custom transformations
- Support for multi-threaded processing
- Integration with external data sources (APIs, message queues)
