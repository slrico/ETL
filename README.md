# Modular C++ ETL Framework

A modular C++ ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework designed for scalable data processing. Supports JSON input, flexible transformation pipelines, and output management, built with clear separation of layers for extensibility and integration.

---

## Features

- **JSON input support**: Seamless ingestion of JSON data with robust parsing and validation.
- **Flexible transformation pipelines**: Compose reusable transformation stages to build complex ETL workflows.
- **Output management**: Flexible sinks for writing results to files, databases, or messaging systems.
- **Layered architecture**: Clear separation of concerns to maximize extensibility and testability.
- **Scalability**: Designed for large data volumes with efficient streaming and parallelism capabilities.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new data sources, transformers, and sinks with well-defined interfaces.
- **Config-driven**: Pipelines configured via JSON or YAML, enabling dynamic workflow changes without recompilation.
- **Type safety**: Modern C++ practices with strong type guarantees and compile-time checks where possible.

---

## Why this framework

- Reduces boilerplate for common ETL tasks by providing building blocks that can be stitched together.
- Enables clean separation between data extraction, transformation, and loading logic.
- Facilitates testing and maintenance through modular design and dependency injection-friendly patterns.
- Supports a variety of data sources and sinks with minimal coupling.

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Source Layer**: Abstractions for data input (e.g., JSON files, streams, REST endpoints).
- **Transformation Layer**: Pipeline stages that transform, filter, aggregate, or enrich data.
- **Sink Layer**: Output destinations (e.g., files, databases, queues).
- **Orchestrator / Engine**: Coordinates extraction, transformation, and loading, manages concurrency and error handling.
- **Config & Metadata**: Centralized configuration for pipelines, schemas, and runtime parameters.

[ Source ] --> [ Transform 1 ] --> [ Transform 2 ] --> ... --> [ Sink ]
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 or newer (C++20 is supported)
- CMake (3.16+ recommended)
- JSON library (e.g., nlohmann/json or your preferred JSON parser)
- Build system capable of linking the framework

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a build directory and configure with CMake
3. Build and run a sample ETL job

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/etl-framework-cpp.git
cd etl-framework-cpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
./etl-framework-sample --config sample_pipeline.json
```

> Note: Adjust commands to match your project structure and sample artifacts.

## Usage

- **Define pipelines**: Create a configuration (JSON/YAML) describing sources, transforms, and sinks.
- **Extend**: Implement new `Source`, `Transform`, or `Sink` plugins by following the provided interfaces.
- **Configure parallelism**: Tune thread pools, batch sizes, and backpressure to scale with data volume.
- **Error handling**: Customize retry policies and dead-letter queues as needed.

### Example Configuration (Pseudo)

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "customer-analytics",
    "source": {
      "type": "json_file",
      "path": "data/input/customers.json",
      "schema": "schemas/customer_schema.json"
    },
    "transforms": [
      { "type": "filter", "condition": "record.active == true" },
      { "type": "normalize", "fields": ["name", "email"] },
      { "type": "enrich", "lookup": "customer_master" }
    ],
    "sink": {
      "type": "parquet_file",
      "path": "data/output/customers.parquet"
    }
  }
}
```

## Extensibility & API

- **Interfaces**: Abstract base classes for `Source`, `Transform`, and `Sink`.
- **Plugins**: Lightweight plugin mechanism to plug in new data sources and destinations.
- **Dependency Injection**: Optional DI container to manage lifetimes and dependencies.
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests designed around isolated components and end-to-end pipelines.

---

## Build & Integration

- Supported platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows (where applicable)
- Dependency management: External JSON library, optional third-party plugins
- CI: CI pipelines available for builds and tests (GitHub Actions, etc.)

If youâ€™d like, I can tailor this README to your exact project layout, add a detailed API section with class diagrams, or generate a sample CMake configuration and a minimal runnable example. Just share any specifics you want included (e.g., exact module names, plugin system details, or preferred JSON library).
